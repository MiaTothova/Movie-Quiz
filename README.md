Movie Quiz is an interactive quiz game mainly aimed at adults but also any child movie lover 12+ years of age. Its main purpose is to provide a fun environment in which the player can test out their knowledge about movies.


## UX
I aimed to create a simple quiz application, with a simplistic design that is fun and engages the user at the same time.


#### The ideal client:
* Adults
* children 12+ years old
* English spaeker
* Movie lover


### The website will help clients to:
* Navigate easily through the website
* Test their knowledge

## Owner Stories
1. As the owner I want to engage the player to keep playing
2. As the owner I want the game to be educational for the user
3. As the owner, I want to give the user the option to choose the game type.

### User Stories
1. As a new visitor, I want to easily navigate the site to start the game.
2. As a visitor, I want to be able to play the game and see my score at the end.
3. As a visitor, I want to see images based on the questions I am answering.


### The Scope
To achieve my goal, I included the following features my website:

1. A game container where all the headings, questions, butons and score will be nested.
2. Fully functioning Buttons to navigate, and control the game.
3. Image area where the relevant image is displayed.


### The skeleton
The Quiz consists of only 1 page index.html which is the main page. I am using Javascript for user functionality. To make selection of buttons possible.

* [Desktop view](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Movie-Quiz/blob/main/readme-images/desktop.png)

* [Tablet view](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Movie-Quiz/blob/main/readme-images/tablet.png)

* [Mobile view](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Movie-Quiz/blob/main/readme-images/mobile.png)

## Features 
* Responsive on all Devices
* Introduction page
* Image, question and answer display
* Pointer with hover effect
* Short game, Long game option
* Score feedback and Home page navigation

### Future features
* Video playback on all questions
* Game dificulty level option
* Update the selected button functionality, and disable hover once a question is selected.
* User name input
* Top scores 

## The Design
I went for a very minimalistic design that is easy on the eyes and doesn't overwhelm the user. There is a nice blue background with black lettering that is easy to see. The hover option adds color to the game.  I didn't choose a background image because I am already using images in my question container, therefore I felt like it would look too messy.

The Quiz has 3 areas:
1. Home Page which displays the heading and 2 buttons for Short / Long game.
2. Game area after choosing a game option, a list of questions with appropriate images and avaialable answers. These questions are shuffled  so that the order is random each time.
3. End page where the questions are hiden and only displays the score panel and Home buttons.
